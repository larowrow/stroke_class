# stroke_class
This project consists of two parts: first, a GCN network classifier was trained using EEG data generated during motor imagery in stroke patients. This classifier can categorize patients into mild and moderate groups. Secondly, a brain network was constructed for each patient based on the EEG data, and cycle structures was identified.
